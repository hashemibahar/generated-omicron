Generative Adversarial Networks Based Synthetic Biology: A Promising Approach to Sars-Cov-2 Mutations Prediction
Synthetic biology, blending biological science and engineering, confronts challenges like the complexity of living systems, difficulties in comprehending the full functionality of genes, the intricate and highly sensitive nature of biological experiments, management of complex data derived from experiments, and ethical concerns. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have emerged as a potent tool, for overcoming these challenges and enhancing data generation in synthetic biology. This study delves into GAN's application in synthetic biology, focusing on generating synthetic Omicron data for SARS-CoV-2. The GAN-generated synthetic Omicron data undergoes evaluation using Machine Learning (ML) and bioinformatics techniques. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on synthetic data exhibits remarkable accuracy, reaching 99.52%, in distinguishing synthetic variants from real Variants of Concern (VOCs). Saliency analysis highlights the key features characterizing the synthetic Omicron data from the original one. Bioinformatic analyses, including multiple sequence alignment, and phylogenetic and immunoinformatic analysis, provide comprehensive insights into the biological activities and taxonomical aspects of the synthetic Omicron variant. In-silico immunoinformatic prediction revealed no significant differences in immunological responses between original and synthetic Omicron. Generated mutations in the genome of the synthetic variant might lead to changes in the transmissibility of the Omicron variant.  The analysis of synthetic Omicron data contributes to a profound comprehension of genetic variations and their implications. The combined use of ML and bioinformatics tools presents a holistic approach to assessing the quality and characteristics of synthetic biological data
